## üìã Features

- **Profile Scraping**: Get detailed information from LinkedIn profiles
- **Company Analysis**: Extract company information, including employees if desired
- **Job Search**: Search for jobs and get recommended positions

## üîß Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Chrome browser installed
- ChromeDriver matching your Chrome version
- A LinkedIn account

### Step 1: Clone or Download the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stickerdaniel/linkedin-mcp-server
cd linkedin-mcp-server
```

Or download and extract the zip file.

### Step 2: Set Up a Virtual Environment

Using `uv` (recommended):

```bash
# Install uv if you don't have it
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Create and activate virtual environment
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
# OR
.venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

Using `uv`:

```bash
uv add "mcp[cli]" selenium httpx inquirer pyperclip
uv add "git+https://github.com/stickerdaniel/linkedin_scraper.git"
uv pip install -e .
pre-commit install
```

### Step 4: Install ChromeDriver

ChromeDriver is required for Selenium to interact with Chrome. You need to install the version that matches your Chrome browser.

1. **Check your Chrome version**:
   - Open Chrome and go to the menu (three dots) > Help > About Google Chrome
   - Note the version number (e.g., 123.0.6312.87)

2. **Download matching ChromeDriver**:
   - Go to [ChromeDriver Downloads](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) / [Chrome for Testing](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/) (Chrome-Version 115+)
   - Download the version that matches your Chrome version
   - Extract the downloaded file

3. **Make ChromeDriver accessible**:
   - **Option 1**: Place it in a directory that's in your PATH (e.g., `/usr/local/bin` on macOS/Linux)
   - **Option 2**: Set the CHROMEDRIVER environment variable to the path where you placed it:
     ```bash
     export CHROMEDRIVER=/path/to/chromedriver  # macOS/Linux
     # OR
     set CHROMEDRIVER=C:\path\to\chromedriver.exe  # Windows
     ```
   - **Option 3**: The server will attempt to auto-detect or prompt you for the path when run

## üöÄ Running the Server

1. **Start the server once manually**:

```bash
# Using uv (recommended)
uv run main.py --no-lazy-init --no-headless
```

2. **Lazy initialization (default behavior)**:
   - The server uses lazy initialization, meaning it will only create the Chrome driver and log in when a tool is actually used
   - You can set environment variables for non-interactive use:
     ```bash
     export LINKEDIN_EMAIL=your.email@example.com
     export LINKEDIN_PASSWORD=your_password
     ```

3. **Configure Claude Desktop**:
   - The server will display and copy to your clipboard the configuration needed for Claude Desktop
   - Open Claude Desktop and go to Settings > Developer > Edit Config
   - Paste the configuration provided by the server
   - Edit the configuration to include your LinkedIn credentials as environment variables

Example Claude Desktop configuration:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "linkedin-scraper": {
      "command": "/path/to/uv",
      "args": ["--directory", "/path/to/project", "run", "main.py", "--no-setup"],
      "env": {
        "LINKEDIN_EMAIL": "your.email@example.com",
        "LINKEDIN_PASSWORD": "your_password"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## üîÑ Using with Claude Desktop

1. **After adding the configuration** to Claude Desktop, restart the application
2. **Start a conversation** with Claude
3. **You'll see tools available** in the tools menu (hammer icon)
4. **You can now ask Claude** to retrieve LinkedIn profiles, search for jobs, etc.

Examples of what you can ask Claude:
- "Can you tell me about Daniels work experience? His LinkedIn profile is https://www.linkedin.com/in/stickerdaniel/"
- "Search for machine learning engineer jobs on LinkedIn"
- "Tell me about Google as a company based on their LinkedIn page"

## üîê Security and Privacy

- Your LinkedIn credentials can be provided through environment variables or stored locally at `~/.linkedin_mcp_credentials.json` with user-only permissions
- Credentials are never exposed to Claude or any other AI and are only used for the LinkedIn login to scrape data
- The server runs on your local machine, not in the cloud
- All LinkedIn scraping happens through your account - be aware that profile visits are visible to other users

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### ChromeDriver Issues

If you encounter ChromeDriver errors:
1. Ensure your Chrome browser is updated
2. Download the matching ChromeDriver version
3. Set the CHROMEDRIVER path correctly
4. Try running with administrator/sudo privileges if permission issues occur

### Authentication Issues

If login fails:
1. Verify your LinkedIn credentials
2. Check if your account has two-factor authentication enabled
3. Try logging in manually to LinkedIn first, then run the server
4. Check your LinkedIn mobile app for a login request after running the server
5. Try to run the server with `--no-headless` to see where the login fails
6. Try to run the server with `--debug` to see more detailed logs

### Connection Issues

If Claude cannot connect to the server:
1. Ensure the server is running when you start it manually
2. Verify the configuration in Claude Desktop is correct
3. Restart Claude Desktop
